### Academic profile

I wanted a very simple website to host information about research, teaching, and contact details, so I wrote my own.

<ul><li>Stylesheet (main.css)</li>
<li>Homepage (index.html)</li>
<li>Teaching information page (teaching.html)</li>
<li>Draft file to store unused material (draft.txt)</li>
<li>favicon (favicon.ico)</li>
<li>icon folder (/icons/)</li></ul>

Feel free to fork and adapt for your own use.
