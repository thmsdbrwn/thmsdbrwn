<h1>Thomas D. Brown</h1>
<p>I am a PhD student in Philosophy at the University of Liverpool. My primary research interests are metaphysics and the philosophy of language. For my PhD project, I aim to develop what I call an asymmetric theory of propositions. Such a theory will properly account for the ontological asymmetry between true and false propositions.</p>

<p>'Propositions are not representational' [accepted for publication in Synthese]</p>
<p>I argue against the common view of propositions as representational entities. In the final section of the paper, I also advance the claim that true and false propositions are ontologically asymmetrical.</p>  </body>
