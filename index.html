  <h1>Thomas D. Brown</h1>
    <p>I am a PhD student in the Philosophy department at the University of Liverpool.</p>
    <p>My primary research interests are metaphysics and the philosophy of language. For my PhD project, I aim to develop what I call an asymmetric theory of propositions. Such a theory will properly account for the ontological asymmetry between true and false propositions.</p>

    <p>'Propositions are not representational', <i>Synthese</i> (forthcoming).</p>
    <p>I argue against the prevalent view that propositions are representational entities. In the final section of the paper, I also advance the claim that true and false propositions are ontologically asymmetric.</p>
